## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) if enabled.

Please include:

- affected version/commit
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- possible fix (if any)

We will acknowledge and triage reports as quickly as possible.
